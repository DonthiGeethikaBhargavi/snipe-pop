# 🎯 SnipePop – Interactive Browser Game

An interactive, single-player browser-based game where users shoot an arrow to hit a moving bubble. On a successful hit, the bubble changes color, disappears, reappears at a random position, and the score increases by 1. The game features a 30-second timer and ends if the player misses 3 consecutive shots. Designed to be fully responsive and playable on all screen sizes including mobile and desktop.

## 🕹️ Objective
Your mission is simple: **hit the moving bubble with your arrow to earn points**. Try to beat your personal best while racing against the clock and avoiding consecutive misses. Stay sharp and climb the leaderboard!
